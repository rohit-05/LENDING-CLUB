# LENDING-CLUB

The data is downloaded  from Lending Club’s website for the years 2016-2018. The dataset has a total of ~1 million rows and 145 columns of which we use only the loans which are completed (Fully Paid, Default and Charged Off). Real data for all of Lending Club’s loans is available as zipped files which can be extracted into csv files using python. This data can be then used to create datasets for further analyses.
